# HandyGest
Third year project : Automatic hand gesture detection

My project is the implementation of Automatic hand gestures detection to operations\ perform tasks on one’s machine. This is done using deep learning with CNNs. The output of this then piped to application and perform actions such as pause, play etc. with respect to video player. The project is coded in python
